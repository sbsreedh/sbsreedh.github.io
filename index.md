## About

Currently pursuing my MS in Electrical Engineering at University Of Southern California, I intend to focus on areas such  machine learning, AI, computer vision and embedded systems. I hope to combine my experience working as an Applications Engineer at Analog Devices added  with the skills and concepts learned in this program to rapidly will help me advance the exciting field of machine learning and computer vision. I believe my creativity, enthusiasm for the field, and maker mentality will be assets to any team I join in the future.
